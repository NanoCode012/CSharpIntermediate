# CSharpIntermediate
My documentation on the intermediate aspects of C# through practical examples.

Hey there! By chance, you have stumbled upon my humble repo. Feel free to check it out. I’m basically putting together what I’ve learnt on C# for others, that means you!

23/Oct : The start of my next CSharp journey. Will take a while due to less time available.

23/Feb : It's been a long time since I started this, and I've been putting it off for quite a long period. I hope to finish it within the next week or so.

9/Mar : I've finally finished this course. I can't believe I spent almost 6 months on a 5 hour course. Unbelievable. Really glad that I finished it, because I learnt so much!

Progress = 100% 
[If there are any problems with code, issue it, I will look into it. Better yet pull request to fix it! :) ]
