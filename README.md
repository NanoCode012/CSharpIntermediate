# CSharpIntermediate
My documentation on the deeper aspects of C# through practical examples, classes.

Hey there! By chance, you have stumbled upon my humble repo. Feel free to check it out. I’m basically putting together what I’ve learnt on C# for others, that means you!

23/Oct : The start of my next CSharp journey. Will take a while due to less time available.

Progress = 0% 
[If there are any problems with code, issue it, I will look into it. Better yet pull request to fix it! :) ]
